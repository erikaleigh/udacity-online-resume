# Udacity Online resume

For completion of [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1).

Udacity's instructions for the project are located [here](https://github.com/erikaleigh/frontend-nanodegree-resume).

### Changes Made:

In `resumeBuilder.js`:

- Created four JavaScript objects to represent four resume sections: "bio", "work", "education", "projects"
- Used encapsulated functions to iterate through each JavaScript object using `jQuery`'s `.append()` and `.replace()` to append information from `resumeBuilder.js`, using the `HTML` written in `helper.js`
- Appended Google Map using `jQuery`
